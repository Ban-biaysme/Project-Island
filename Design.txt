 Green Island is an island that have many elements, like 
 
 --> different type  of creatures
 --> Small and Big plants
 --> Water patches and stream
 --> Creature can move in the island
 --> Plant can grow

 =====================================================================
 As my designing purpose
 
 At the top of the class structure  I have an Interface named--> THINGS
 Things have the common methods that applied in all classes

 	-- public String getName();
	-- public int getSize();
	-- public int getX_pos();
	-- public int getY_pos();
	-- public String toString();
	-- public char getSymbol();
	
 --> I have created a Array list of all Things in the Entry point that can access 
 	all creatures, plants and waters.
 	
 The following classes have implemented the Things
 1) Creature
 2) Plants
 3) Water
 
 1) CREATURE--> is the super class of
 				a)  Rabbit
 				b)  Cat
 				c)  Kiwi
 				d)  Sparrow
 	
 	Below are the common properties that have implemented  for all the creatures			
 	protected String name;
	protected int size;
	protected int x_pos;
	protected int y_pos;
	protected int speed;
	protected char symbol;
	
	2)  PLANT --> is the super class of 
					a) BigPlant
					b) SmallTree
					
	3) WATER -->   is the super class of
					a) Stream
					b) WaterPatch
					
   ISLAND class have the array list of plants, creatures and waters
   
   --> I have created the island in the Island class
   
   --> Later based on the movement of the creatures I have updated the Island
   
   
	Main method --> Entry point
	
		-->  The whole program runs in console
	 	-->  I have used switch cases for all the methods
	 	--> Main method used for adding all the creatures
	 	--> Add Plants and Waters
	 	--> Draw the island
	 	--> Move the position as per speed and update world
	 	--> Automatically turn for 10 times


   Main Features of the this project is--> 
   
     -> Usage of Interface
     -> Concept of Class and object
     -> Super and sub class
     -> Implementation of inheritance
     -> Application of overloading constructor
     -> implementation of Thread
     -> object type casting
     -> Method overloading
     -> Encapsulation for variable
     -> Usage of Access specifier
     -> Implementation of switch case
     -> Implementation of exception handling
